# Simple AI Animations

Welcome to the Simple AI Animations repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing a collection of scripts that generate educational animations demonstrating fundamental AI concepts using Python and various libraries like Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and more.

## Repository Overview

This repository aims to provide easy-to-understand, visually appealing animations that illustrate key AI and machine learning concepts. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an educator seeking visual aids for teaching, these animations are designed to make complex ideas more accessible and engaging.

## Features

- **Neural Network Learning Animations:** Watch how neural networks learn and adapt to data over time.
- **Function Fitting Visualizations:** See how AI models fit various functions, handling noise and gaps in the data.
- **Interactive Plots:** Explore interactive visualizations that allow you to adjust parameters and see the effects in real-time.
- **Educational Code Snippets:** Each animation comes with well-documented code snippets to help you understand the underlying logic and algorithms.

## Getting Started
